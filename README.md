Simple Calls & SMS using a SIM900A GSM modem

-Use a 5V to 3.3V TTL Logic Shifter. A simple 5V-to-3V3 logic shifter can be designed using 1N4148 diode 

-Use a 2, 4, or 8-channel level switching I/O module. This is an 8-channel level switching bidirectional I/O module:

-Next, connect the modem’s Rxd, Txd, and ground pins with those of RPi via the level-switching circuit or I/O module. Now, you are ready to communicate with the modem over the serial port.

#To begin, we must prepare the GSM modem for cellular communication. Insert a SIM card into the SIM cardholder of the SIM900A modem. The modem is similar to a mobile phone and requires a SIM card to connect with a cellular network. 

#Next, turn on the GSM modem by connecting the modem to a power adaptor (5V-12V, 2A). The modem’s status LED or Network LED will start blinking.
